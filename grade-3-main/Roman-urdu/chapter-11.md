---

### 1. **"id" sound kab hota hai?**
- Jab verb ka aakhri sound **"t" ya "d"** ho, to "ed" ka sound **"id"** ban jata hai.
- **Example:**
  - "needed" (nee-did)
  - "wanted" (wan-tid)

Ye dono verbs "t" aur "d" pe khatam hote hain, is liye yahan "id" sound lagta hai.

---

### 2. **"t" sound kab hota hai?**
- Jab verb ka aakhri sound **voiceless** ho (aise sounds jo awaaz nahi banate, jaise "k," "s," ya "p"), to "ed" ka sound **"t"** hota hai.
- **Example:**
  - "asked" (askt)
  - "missed" (mist)

Yahan verbs ka aakhri sound halki awaaz ya **voiceless** hota hai, is liye "t" sound lagta hai.

---

### 3. **"d" sound kab hota hai?**
- Jab verb ka aakhri sound **voiced** ho (aise sounds jo awaaz banate hain, jaise "l," "n," "g"), to "ed" ka sound **"d"** ban jata hai.
- **Example:**
  - "buzzed" (buzd)
  - "called" (cald)

Yahan verbs ka aakhri sound **voiced** hota hai, is liye "d" sound lagta hai.

---

### Ab samjhein yeh words kaise pronounce hote hain:
1. **Delighted** → **id sound** (kyun ke "t" par khatam hota hai).  
2. **Decided** → **id sound** (kyun ke "d" par khatam hota hai).  
3. **Liked** → **t sound** (kyun ke "k" par khatam hota hai, jo voiceless hai).  
4. **Tried** → **d sound** (kyun ke "i" ke baad aata hai aur voiced hai).  
5. **Enjoyed** → **d sound** (kyun ke "y" ke baad aata hai aur voiced hai).

---

### Yad rakhne ka tareeqa:
1. Agar "t" ya "d" pe khatam ho → **id**.
2. Agar voiceless ho → **t**.
3. Agar voiced ho → **d**.

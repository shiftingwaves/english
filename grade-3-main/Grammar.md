# **Chapter 5: Grammar**



### **Countable and Uncountable Nouns**



#### **Read Me First**:
- **What are Countable Nouns?**  
  Countable nouns are the things we can **count one by one**. They can have singular (1) and plural (more than 1) forms.  
  - Example: **Books**, **Carrots**, **Potatoes**.  

- **What are Uncountable Nouns?**  
  Uncountable nouns are the things we **cannot count** individually. These are usually in **singular form**, and we measure them in quantities like kilograms, liters, or cups.  
  - Example: **Rice**, **Water**, **Soup**.



#### **Exercise: Identify Countable and Uncountable Nouns**

**Task:**  
Write **“C”** in the box if the item is **Countable**, and **“U”** if the item is **Uncountable**.  



1. **Carrots** → [  ]  
2. **Rice** → [  ]  
3. **Potato** → [  ]  
4. **Books** → [  ]  
5. **Thread Spools** → [  ]  
6. **Soup** → [  ]  
7. **Fruits (Grapes and Berries)** → [  ]  
8. **Water (Waterfall)** → [  ]  



### **Hints for Solving**:
- Look at the item. If it is something you can count one by one (like carrots or books), write **"C"** for countable.  
- If it is something you measure in quantities (like rice or water), write **"U"** for uncountable.

### **Solved Exercise: Use of the Modal Verbs Can / Cannot**



#### **Read Me:**
- **"Can"** is used to show **ability** (matlab aap kya kar sakte hain).  
  - Example: "One boy can swim."
- **"Cannot"** is used to show **inability** (matlab aap kya nahi kar sakte).  
  - Example: "One boy cannot swim."
- **Note:** "Cannot" is the written form, and for speech, we often use its contraction **"can’t"**.



### **ii. Write three things that you can do and three things you cannot.**

1. **Three things I can do:**  
   - I can run.  
   - I can write.

### Articles: 'A', 'An', and 'The'

**What are Articles?**  
Articles are words that define a noun as specific or unspecific. There are three articles in English: 'a', 'an', and 'the'.  

<hr style="height:5px; border:none; background-color:gray;" /> 


# **Chapter 6: Grammar**

### 'A' and 'An' - Indefinite Articles

**Using 'A'**  
'A' is used before words that begin with a consonant sound. For example:
- **a cat**
- **a dog**  

**Using 'An'**  
'An' is used before words that begin with a vowel sound. For example:
- **an apple**
- **an orange**  

Both 'a' and 'an' are used with **singular nouns** when referring to something that is not specific.

---

### 'The' - Definite Article

**Using 'The'**  
'The' is used when referring to a specific noun, whether it is singular or plural. For example:
- **the teacher** (specific teacher)
- **the station** (specific station)
- **the football** (specific football)  

---

### Key Differences:  
- Use **'a'** or **'an'** when referring to a general, non-specific thing.
  - Example: **a book** (any book, not a specific one).
  - Example: **an apple** (any apple, not a particular one).
- Use **'the'** when referring to something specific.
  - Example: **the boy** (a particular boy).
  - Example: **the oranges** (specific oranges, known to both speaker and listener).

Here are the filled-in blanks with the correct articles and explanations:



1. **He decided one day that ____ things had to be changed.**  
   **Answer:** **the**  
   **Explanation:** 'The' is used here because **"things"** refers to specific things that need to be changed. We are talking about a particular set of things that are understood in the context, which makes "the" the correct article.

2. **People saw ____ whole new side of him.**  
   **Answer:** **a**  
   **Explanation:** 'A' is used before a **singular noun** that is not specific. "Whole new side" is referring to a side of him that has not been specified before, so it is a general reference to a side, not a specific one.

3. **All Rizwan needed was ____ little more time than others to talk.**  
   **Answer:** **a**  
   **Explanation:** 'A' is used here because "little more time" is a **countable noun** (a quantity of time), and we're talking about a non-specific amount of time. "A little more time" refers to some extra time, but it is not a specific, known amount.

4. **The Day of Silence was ____ day Rizwan's true nature became known.**  
   **Answer:** **the**  
   **Explanation:** 'The' is used because **"Day of Silence"** is a specific event that has already been defined. It refers to a particular day that is significant and known in the context of the story, so "the" is the appropriate article.

--- 

Here are the correct articles for each sentence, along with explanations:

1. **I saw ____ elephant yesterday.**  
   **Answer:** **an**  
   **Explanation:** 'An' is used because "elephant" begins with a vowel sound (the "e" in "elephant").

2. **I am ____ student of class III.**  
   **Answer:** **a**  
   **Explanation:** 'A' is used because "student" begins with a consonant sound (the "s" in "student").

3. **She stayed there for ____ hour.**  
   **Answer:** **an**  
   **Explanation:** 'An' is used because "hour" starts with a vowel sound (the "h" is silent, so it starts with a vowel sound "ow-er").

4. **____ boy in red shirt is my friend.**  
   **Answer:** **The**  
   **Explanation:** 'The' is used because "boy" refers to a specific boy, probably known to both the speaker and listener.

5. **Ahmad is ____ best boy from my classmates.**  
   **Answer:** **the**  
   **Explanation:** 'The' is used because Ahmad is being referred to as the **best** (a superlative), which is specific.

6. **I saw ____ lion in the zoo.**  
   **Answer:** **a**  
   **Explanation:** 'A' is used because "lion" is being referred to in a general way, not a specific lion that has been mentioned before.

# Chapter: 8

### **Read Me:**

A **Possessive Pronoun** is a pronoun that shows who or what owns something. For example:  
- *The pencils are mine.*  
- *These are yours.*  

The **possessive pronouns** are:  
**hers, mine, ours, theirs, and yours.**

---

### **Example Exercise:**

**Read the following sentences carefully and notice the possessive pronouns used:**

1. **This cap is mine.**  
2. **That cap is yours.**  
3. **This bag belongs to Hina. It is hers.**  
4. **This is Ali’s book. It is his.**

---

### **Instructions & Exercises:**

#### **1. Use a possessive pronoun from the box to complete each sentence.**

**[his, ours, mine, yours, ours]**

**Exercise (Solved):**

1. My parents and I live in this house. The house is **ours**.  
   *(Explanation: "ours" shows that the house belongs to "my parents and I.")*

2. The jacket belongs to Beena. It is **hers**.  
   *(Explanation: "hers" shows that the jacket belongs to Beena.)*

3. I bought a new bike. It is **mine**.  
   *(Explanation: "mine" shows that the bike belongs to me.)*

4. The bag belongs to Amir. The bag is **his**.  
   *(Explanation: "his" shows that the bag belongs to Amir.)*

---

### **Explanation:**

- **Possessive pronouns** replace the need to mention the owner again after the object. For example, instead of saying "The jacket belongs to Beena. The jacket is hers," we use "hers" to avoid repetition.
- **'Mine'** refers to something that belongs to you (the speaker).
- **'Yours'** refers to something that belongs to the person you are speaking to.
- **'His'** refers to something that belongs to a male.
- **'Hers'** refers to something that belongs to a female.
- **'Ours'** refers to something that belongs to a group, including the speaker.
- **'Theirs'** refers to something that belongs to a group that does not include the speaker.


### **Read Me:**

A verb is a word that shows **action** or **condition**. It is the most important word in a sentence. No sentence can be made without it.



### **1. Underline the verbs in the following sentences:**

In each sentence, find the verb and underline it.

#### **Exercise (Solved):**

1. **The sun rises** in the east.  
   (Verb: **rises**)  
   *(Explanation: "rises" is the action the sun is doing. It shows movement, so it is the verb.)*

2. **My brother goes** to school on time.  
   (Verb: **goes**)  
   *(Explanation: "goes" is the action. It tells us what the brother is doing – going to school.)*

3. **My friends are coming** to my birthday party at 5 p.m.  
   (Verb: **are coming**)  
   *(Explanation: "are coming" is a combination of "are" (helping verb) and "coming" (action verb). It shows the action that friends will do.)*

4. **Sameer has read** two storybooks.  
   (Verb: **has read**)  
   *(Explanation: "has read" is a present perfect form of the verb. "Has" is a helping verb, and "read" is the main action verb.)*

5. **We went** to watch a movie yesterday.  
   (Verb: **went**)  
   *(Explanation: "went" is the past form of the verb "go." It tells us the action happened in the past.)*



### **2. Use the verbs 'do' and 'have' in the sentences below:**

Fill in the blanks with the correct form of **'do'** or **'have'**.

#### **Exercise (Solved):**

1. He can **wear** a red shirt.  
   *(Explanation: "wear" is the verb here, and it is an action he can do. "Do" is not needed here.)*

2. He can **do** his homework at night.

   **Reason:** The verb "listened" is in the past tense, indicating a completed action.

2. **My father will cook food today. → Future**  
   **Reason:** The auxiliary verb "will" indicates future tense, showing an action that is yet to happen.

3. **Children play in the park. → Present**  
   **Reason:** The verb "play" is in the present tense, indicating a habitual action or general truth.

4. **I always speak truth. → Present**  
   **Reason:** The word "always" suggests a habitual action, and "speak" is in the present tense.

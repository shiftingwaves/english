**Roman Urdu Explanation:**

Yeh grammar ka sabaq "Possession" yani "Milkiyat" ke bare mein hai. Is mein hum seekhenge ke kaise bataya jata hai ke koi cheez kiski hai. Hum "Possessive Adjectives" istemal karte hain.

(This grammar lesson is about "Possession," meaning "Ownership." In this, we will learn how to show that something belongs to someone. We use "Possessive Adjectives.")

**Explanation of Possessive Adjectives in Roman Urdu:**

"Possessive Adjectives" woh alfaaz hain jo humein batate hain ke koi cheez kiski hai. Teen aam istemal hone wale "Possessive Adjectives" yeh hain:

("Possessive Adjectives" are words that tell us to whom something belongs. Three commonly used "Possessive Adjectives" are:)

*   **Her:** Yeh lafz larkiyon ya aurton ke liye istemal hota hai. Jab hum batana chahte hain ke koi cheez kisi larki ya aurat ki hai, toh hum "her" istemal karte hain. Misal ke taur par, "These are *her* dresses" ka matlab hai "Yeh uske kapre hain."

    (This word is used for girls or women. When we want to show that something belongs to a girl or woman, we use "her." For example, "These are *her* dresses" means "These are her clothes.")

*   **His:** Yeh lafz larkon ya mardon ke liye istemal hota hai. Jab hum batana chahte hain ke koi cheez kisi larke ya mard ki hai, toh hum "his" istemal karte hain. Misal ke taur par, "This is *his* ball" ka matlab hai "Yeh uski gend hai."

    (This word is used for boys or men. When we want to show that something belongs to a boy or man, we use "his." For example, "This is *his* ball" means "This is his ball.")

*   **Their:** Yeh lafz jab hum zyada logon ke bare mein baat kar rahe hote hain aur batana chahte hain ke koi cheez un sab ki hai, toh istemal hota hai. Misal ke taur par, "This is *their* house" ka matlab hai "Yeh unka ghar hai."

    (This word is used when we are talking about more than one person and want to show that something belongs to all of them. For example, "This is *their* house" means "This is their house.")

**Exercise Solution and Explanation in Roman Urdu:**

Ab hum exercise ko hal karte hain:

(Now we solve the exercise:)

*   **Nimra is a girl. This is *her* cat.** Nimra ek larki hai, isliye hum "her" istemal karenge. Matlab hai "Yeh uski billi hai."

    (Nimra is a girl, so we will use "her." It means "This is her cat.")

*   **Usman is a doctor. This is *his* clinic.** Usman ek mard hai, isliye hum "his" istemal karenge. Matlab hai "Yeh uska clinic hai."

    (Usman is a man, so we will use "his." It means "This is his clinic.")

*   **Amna and Ambreen are sisters. Yunas is *their* father.** Amna aur Ambreen do behnein hain, yani zyada log hain, isliye hum "their" istemal karenge. Matlab hai "Yunas unke walid hain."

    (Amna and Ambreen are two sisters, meaning there are more than one person, so we will use "their." It means "Yunas is their father.")

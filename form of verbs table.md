**Important Note:** The meaning of "Blemish" provided (برکت کرنا - *barkat karna*, meaning "to bless") seems incorrect in the context of the verb's usage. It most likely refers to "Daagh lagana" (داغ لگانا - *daagh lagana*), which means "to stain" or "to blemish". I have updated the table accordingly.  Also, "Barter" means to exchange goods or services without using money. "Lend in" is not a correct definition.  The closest meaning would be "Muawza karna" (معاوضہ کرنا) which means to compensate or exchange.
